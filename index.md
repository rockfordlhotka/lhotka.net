Hello, I'm Rocky Lhotka, distributed software architect, open source contributor, author, speaker, and CTO.

## Projects

I've been a creator and contributor in the open source world since the mid-1990's. Here are some of the projects I'm involved in:

* [CSLA .NET](https://cslanet.com), A home for your business logic
* [Humanitarian Toolbox](http://www.htbox.org), in particular the [Kids ID App](https://github.com/HTBox/MobileKidsIdApp)

I use the [GitHub Sponsors program](https://github.com/sponsors/rockfordlhotka) to enable folks to support my CSLA .NET open source work. Thank you very much to those who sponsor this work, you make a big difference!

## Speaking

I speak at events around the world, including [VS Live](https://vslive.com), [Cloud & Containers Live](https://cclive360.com/), and many others.

My [speaker profile on sessionize](https://sessionize.com/rockfordlhotka/) includes information about the topics I am focused on at the moment.

## Publications

I've written many books over the years, along with articles, [blog posts](https://blog.lhotka.net), and other content. 

In recent years I've been publishing books and videos in PDF format, and they are available from the [CSLA .NET store](https://store.lhotka.net).

I have a page with [many of the book covers](books.md) from over the years.
