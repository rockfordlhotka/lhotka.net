[![](binary/webcast120x90.gif)](http://www.aspnetwebcasts.com/?id=1WM6F244-38VW-2NS1-JW19-V4U02TL90F6V)MSDN has taken to organizing a week of webcasts on ASP.NET. Last year it was their most popular event, and probably will be again this year.

As part of the event I am presenting a webcast on implementation of custom authentication and authorization in ASP.NET.

[Click here](http://www.aspnetwebcasts.com/?id=1WM6F244-38VW-2NS1-JW19-V4U02TL90F6V) to register for the event.
