One week from today, on December 6, at the Microsoft office in Bloomington, MN you can attend a free two-track .NET developer training event: [Code Mastery](http://www.codemastery.com/).

This event includes content from the Microsoft PDC 2010 event, plus custom content covering topics such as:

- Windows Phone 7 (WP7) development
- How to really use the MVVM design pattern in WPF
- SQL Azure
- Combining Scrum and TFS 2010
- Best practices for development in .NET
- and more!!


If that isn’t enough, there’s a raffle at the end of the day, with great prizes (including an MSDN Universal subscription), and our special guest Carl Franklin from .NET Rocks! will be in attendance to spice up the event.
