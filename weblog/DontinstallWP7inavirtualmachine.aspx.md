Hopefully this can save someone some time. I spent a couple hours setting up a virtual machine and installing the Windows Phone 7 dev tools, only to find that the phone emulator won’t run in a virtual machine. It turns out that this is because the emulator *is a virtual machine* and you can’t run a virtual machine in a virtual machine.
