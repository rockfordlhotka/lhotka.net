<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">I have this long-standing theory and thought Iâ€™d share it. The theory goes like this:<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></font></font></font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">First there was DOS.<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>

<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">Then there was Windows which ran on DOS.<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>

<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">Then DOS was emulated in Windows.<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>

<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">Then there was .NET which ran on Windows.<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>

<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">Then Windows was emulated in .NET.<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Of course that last bit hasn't happened yet, but I expect it is just a matter of time before Microsoft's OS becomes .NET and Win32 becomes an emulated artifact. I also expect that branding-wise Windows will remain the foremost brand. I think this is why the .NET brand is already being deprecated. .NET as a brand must fade so it can be reborn like the phoenix in the future - as Windows.</font>
