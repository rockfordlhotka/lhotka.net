OK, this is really cool: http://www.devfish.net/articles/inbetween/

It appears that Microsoft, having reserved the convention center for the two weeks of Tech Ed (Dev week and IT Pro week), is allowing the user groups in the region to take advantage of the idle space in the intervening weekend. That is so cool!!

But now, to be fair, Microsoft should provide two days of conference center space and AV in <u>&lt;insert your city here&gt;</u>, don't you think? :)
