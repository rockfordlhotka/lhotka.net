[![codemastery](binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CodeMasteryFREEEVENTBoston_CC7B/codemastery_3.png "codemastery")](http://www.codemastery.com/) It is hard to believe that in just over 2 weeks I’ll be in Boston for the exciting [Code Mastery event](http://www.codemastery.com/)!

On **Feb 11, at the Microsoft office in Waltham** there’s this FREE two track technical event covering topics like Silverlight, SharePoint development, BizTalk, TFS, CSLA .NET and coding best practices.

Time is growing short, and seats are filling up, but there’s still space left. Head over to http://www.codemastery.com, check out the agenda and register today!
