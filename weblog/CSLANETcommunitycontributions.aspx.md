One of the most important "features" of CSLA .NET is the vibrant community that surrounds it. I am humbled by, and very appreciative of, the amount of time and effort people put into this community - helping other people more effectively learn and use the concepts from my books.

The most recent examples? Updates to several of the major community contributions for CSLA .NET 2.0:

- <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p><a href="http://www.onelittlevictory.com/">One Little Victory</a> (tutorial website)</o:p>
