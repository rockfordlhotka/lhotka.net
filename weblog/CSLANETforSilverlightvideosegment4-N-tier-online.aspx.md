The 4th video in the CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series is now available. This is 65 minutes of in-depth content covering the creation of 2-, 3- and 4-tier applications using CSLA .NET for Silverlight.

If you’d like to get a better idea of the structure, style and quality of the video series you can download a [FREE promotional montage](http://www.lhotka.net/files/cslalight/SL0104-Promo.wmv).

The N-Tier Architecture segment covers a lot of ground, including these topics:

1. How to share code files and objects between a Silverlight client and .NET server
2. How to have server-only and client-only sections in your business layer
3. How to configure an ASP.NET server for the Silverlight data portal
4. How to configure the Silverlight client to use a remote data portal
5. How to use the MobileFactory attribute to create an observer object to validate inbound client requests on the web server
6. How to set up the web server to act as a "bridge", routing all client calls to a real application server behind a second firewall
