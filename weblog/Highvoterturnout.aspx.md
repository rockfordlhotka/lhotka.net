“If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice” - Rush<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p>

According to [this article](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/ap/20041103/ap_on_el_pr/eln_voter_turnout) yesterday's turnout was the highest in 3 decades, with just *under* 60% of eligible voters actually giving any thought regarding what happens to them.<o:p></o:p>

It boggles my mind that over 40% of Americans *chose* to allow the rest of us decide their fate. <o:p></o:p>

Look around you. Of every five people you see, two of them abandoned their civic and patriotic duty yesterday. Effectively they surrendered their rights as American citizens and gave them to the rest of us.<o:p></o:p>

What are you people? Apathetic? Disillusioned? Dim? <o:p></o:p>

To make matters worse, we already have people claiming that Bush had a [“decisive” victory](http://patzer.us/blog/archives/000037.html). Nothing is decisive when nearly half your population has decided to be voiceless chattel...<o:p></o:p>

What this *really* means is that the results are more along this line:<o:p></o:p>


| <font color="#000000">Bush<o:p></o:p></font> | <font color="#000000">30%<o:p></o:p></font> |
| --- | --- |
| <font color="#000000">Kerry<o:p></o:p></font> | <font color="#000000">28%<o:p></o:p></font> |
| <font color="#000000">Nader or other<o:p></o:p></font> | <font color="#000000">1%<o:p></o:p></font> |
| <font color="#000000">Voiceless chattel<o:p></o:p></font> | <font color="#000000">41%<o:p></o:p></font> |


So Bush’s “decisive” victory is due to less than 1/3 of the eligible voter support.<o:p></o:p>
