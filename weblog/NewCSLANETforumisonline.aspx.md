There's a new online CSLA .NET forum, hosted by [Magenic Technologies](http://www.magenic.com/), with the [Community Server](http://communityserver.org/) software provided by [Telligent](http://www.telligent.com/).

http://forums.lhotka.net

As always, the home site for CSLA .NET is http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet, where you can find news, answers to frequently asked questions and downloads of the framework and related resources.

This forum is a replacement for http://groups.msn.com/CSLANET - which has served the community for a number of years. Unfortunately groups.msn.com turns out to be rather unreliable and slow, so the forum had to be moved. If you are looking for older discussions you may want to check there. Associated with that forum is [www.searchcsla.com](http://www.searchcsla.com/), which allows you to search the archive of that older forum.

But now we've got this new forum, which will hopefully overcome some of the limitations and reliability issues of MSN - so please make good use of the forum and enjoy!
