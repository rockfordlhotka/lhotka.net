I have put CSLA 4 Preview 4 [online for download](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

CSLA 4 requires Visual Studio 2010, .NET 4 and (optionally) Silverlight 4.

There are a lot of changes in CSLA 4 - make sure to read the change log!

This will be the last preview, and it includes all planned CSLA 4 functionality *except*:

- New authorization rules system
- INotifyDataErrorInfo support (SL only)
- Class level DataAnnotation attributes


My intent is to finish these three items within the next two weeks, and then enter a beta phase.

Your feedback now and through the beta phase is absolutely invaluable to the quality of the release. If you are using or planning to use .NET 4 or Silverlight 4 please take a look at the preview and let me know your thoughts and any bugs you find by replying to [this thread on the forum](http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/t/8807.aspx).
