Slashdot has some funny ones from time to time. Like [this one](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/07/166215&amp;from=rss), where the author contends that AJAX is a new Microsoft technology.

(note: the [article](http://www.usabilityviews.com/ajaxsucks.html) he links to about AJAX is worth the read!)

But AJAX isn't new. It is old - many years old, for all that it didn't become popular until recently.

And it was the tech darling Google that made it popular, not Microsoft.

Sure it is based on technology Microsoft put in the browser many years ago, but until Firefox added support and Google used it broadly it was a sleeper...

But on slashdot everything negative must be associated with Microsoft - it's a rule I guess...
