A beta release of a CSLA 4 version 4.3 update is now available (version 4.3.11) .

You can get it from the [CSLA download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

This is an update to the existing version 4.3 code that includes several bug fixes and a few new features. Most notably:

- Fixed a concurrency bug with the data portal
- Fixed a XAML data binding bug with the PropertyInfo control
- Substantial bug fixes and enhancements to the Windows Forms CslaActionExtender control
- Better exception messages when methods/properties can’t be found


There are others as well – see the [change log](http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=1c287e08-d428-4c27-b538-d588e3c55775) for details.

I expect the beta period to last about two weeks, followed by a final release of this 4.3 update.
