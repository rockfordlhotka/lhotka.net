Just a quick reminder that the official 3 day [CSLA .NET training roadshow](http://www.cslausatour.com/) continues through the summer. You can still attend in one of these cities:

- Orlando
- Chicago
- Washington, DC
- Dallas


The feedback from the classes so far has been excellent! I sat in on part of the class last week in Minneapolis, and I can see why. Miguel is a very good teacher, and his hands-on, continual lab style is a refreshing change from traditional powerpoint-heavy training.
