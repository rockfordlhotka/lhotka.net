CSLA .NET version 2.1 is now available for download from http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx

Please make sure to read the [Change log](http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?area=4&amp;id=f12cc951-0452-42d1-96a6-cfa7656863b1) for this release, as there are substantial changes to validation, authorization and other parts of the framework. There are a limited number of breaking changes that may affect your code, so please review the document before attempting to upgrade from 2.0 to 2.1.

The vast majority of the changes in version 2.1 are due to the community feedback from the great members of the [online forum](http://forums.lhotka.net). I would like to thank everyone who provided feedback and input into the process!
