As part of the [CSLA Light](http://www.lhotka.net/cslalight) project we created a unit testing engine for Silverlight and donated it to the community as [UnitDriven](http://www.codeplex.com/UnitDriven).

We now have our first community contribution to this open-source project, in the form of a really nice visual change. Here's the author's blog post on the topic:

Thank you Staxmanade! This is a really nice visual upgrade, and more importantly a major usability upgrade. I love it!

The next release of the CSLA Light unit tests will be linked to the new version of UnitDriven, and having used it for just a day or so, I can say it is a big help.
