I have sent off the final code for the book to Apress, which officially means that I have RTM code at this point. You can [go here](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/csla20.aspx) to download the release code for VB or C#.

As a bonus, I also put a test release of a WCF data portal channel up for download - you can getÂ if [from this page](http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=0eec56bb-2a61-47c4-a9ca-f98371db1cad).

**Update: **Today (March 22) I recieved my author's copies of the Expert C# 2005 Business Objects book - so it is most certainly in print. What a joy it is to actually see the results of the past several months of work!!
