<li>Las Vegas</li></ul><br>[Click here](http://www.cslausatour.com) for all the information.<br><br>![](http://www.lhotka.net/images/csla_logo1_42.png) | **"I came to this class with two things, a very large problem to solve and a very modest knowledge of CSLA.  What I left with was a solution to the problem using CSLA and enough knowledge to create a prototype on my airplane trip home.  This class was worth every penny and every minute of time.  The instructor, Miguel Castro, was awesome.  DUNN Training Rocks!!" **<br><br>**Leah Bialic, Cambridge Soft**<br><br>**<font color="#006400">"The approach taken with this class was refreshing. Instead of the typical instructor/student environment, I felt like I was in a room of colleagues working together to learn; this was a definite plus.&nbsp; I rate this class 10 out of 10.&nbsp; Overall, this class was everything I needed.&nbsp; Miguel's knowledge and passion for CSLA made it worth every penny." </font>**<br><br>**<font color="#006400">Alan Gamboa, CCG Systems</font>**<br><br><br><br><br><font color="#000000"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'">"This class provides a wonderful, concrete clarification to the CSLA .Net Framework."</span></b> </font><br><br><br>**<font color="#000000">Theo Moore, Magenic</font>**<br><br>**<font color="#006400">"This class was a huge help. Definitely money well spent. "</font>**<br><br>**<font color="#006400">Chris Williams, Magenic</font>** |
