Here is a summary of all seven video segments:

**Introduction
**In this video you will become familiar with the CSLA .NET framework's vision, goals and overall scope. You will be introduced to the various architectures supported by CSLA .NET for Silverlight, and the requirements necessary to build Silverlight and CSLA .NET for Silverlight applications.

**The Basics
**This video details the basic steps of creating a CSLA .NET business object that interacts with a server-side web service to get its data. The process of using data binding to connect the object to the Silverlight UI is also covered. At the end of this video you will understand all the basic steps and coding structures necessary to build a simple CSLA .NET for Silverlight application.

**Client-only Architectures
**This video covers the various client-only scenarios supported by CSLA .NET for Silverlight, including true client-only applications and “edge” applications that interact with remote services. This video builds on *The Basics* to dive deeper into the various options for building client-only applications.

**N-tier Architectures - coming soon
**In this video you will learn how to build 2-, 3- and 4-tier applications using CSLA .NET for Silverlight. CSLA .NET allows your UI, business object and data access code to remain the same in all these configurations, but there are numerous configuration options and choices you can make to optimize how your application works in each of these scenarios.

**Business Object Types - coming soon
**In this video you will learn how to implement each of the business object stereotypes supported by CSLA .NET. These include editable objects, lists of objects, read-only objects, read-only lists, name/value lists, command objects and more. At the end of this video you will understand the purpose behind each stereotype, and the coding structure to use when building business objects for each stereotype.

**N-tier Data Access - coming soon
**This video details the various options supported by CSLA .NET for data access in n-tier scenarios. You will learn how to put data access code into your business class, or into a separate data access assembly, along with the pros and cons of each technique. You will also learn about the ObjectFactory attribute and base class, that can be used to create pluggable data access layers for an application.

**Authentication and Authorization - coming soon
**In this video you will learn about the various authentication and authorization techniques supported by CSLA .NET for Silverlight. Authentication options include Windows, ASP.NET Membership Provider and custom authentication. Authorization is the same as CSLA .NET for Windows, and includes per-property and per-type authorization, along with Silverlight UI controls to simplify the creation of your interface
