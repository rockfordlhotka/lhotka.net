[Jason Bock](http://www.jasonbock.net), a fellow [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com)employee, has put together a [web site](http://www.dotnetlanguages.net)with information about any and all .NET languages. Since I love programming languages and language innovations, I think this site is really cool!

Thanks Jason!
