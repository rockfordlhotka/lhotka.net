[![image](binary/WindowsLiveWriter/VSLiveDallas2008inDecember_A7EB/image_thumb.png)](binary/WindowsLiveWriter/VSLiveDallas2008inDecember_A7EB/image_2.png) I'm giving four talks at VS Live in Dallas, plus participating in a community panel Tuesday evening. You can see my [list of talks here](http://www.lhotka.net/Presentations.aspx), which includes a talk specifically focused on CSLA .NET (due to popular demand from attendees at previous VS Live shows).

I have a special promo code you can use when registering to get $300 off registration. Just use code **SPLHO** when [registering online](http://vslive.com/2008/dallas/rates.aspx).
