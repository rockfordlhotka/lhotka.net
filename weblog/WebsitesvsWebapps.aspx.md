Joe writes a nice summary of why a web app is not a web page – it is something different, and in important ways.

This distinction becomes very important when considering building H5/js apps on WinRT in Windows 8, or if you believe (in general) that H5/js will replace existing dev platforms like Java and .NET. For that to happen, we have to stop thinking about HTML and js as web technologies – they must be thought of as general purpose technologies that sometimes happen to be used on the web too.
