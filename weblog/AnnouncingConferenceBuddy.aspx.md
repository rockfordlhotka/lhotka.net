That changes now with the introduction of ConferenceBuddy:

- [ConferenceBuddy](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conferencebuddy/id504591947) on iTunes App Store
- [ConferenceBuddy](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.magenic.conferencebuddy) on Android Market
- [ConferenceBuddy](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/a97f78b4-283f-4737-a624-a8d110ba8d4a) on Windows Phone Marketplace


Conference Buddy allows you to easily:

- Use one click to join conference calls without having to remember, fumble for and enter long conference codes
- Display your upcoming conferences on an easy to view and navigate list
- Join as a leader or participant
- Store multiple conferences
