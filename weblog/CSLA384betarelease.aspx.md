CSLA .NET 3.8.4 is now available as a beta download. This is mostly a bug fix release to address a few issues from 3.8.3, plus some ASP.NET MVC work.

Version 3.8.4 targets .NET 3.5 and Silverlight 3 (though with a little effort it works with Silverlight 4 as well).

See the change log for a list of changes. There arenâ€™t many, but if they affect you then they are important.

The only feature change in 3.8.4 is that most of the new ASP.NET MVC 2 support from CSLA 4 has been back-ported to 3.8. This means that the Csla.Web.Mvc project now targets and supports ASP.NET MVC 2, and provides more features and functionality that was there in 3.8.3.

This is a stable beta, given the small number of changes (other than the MVC support). So if you are affected by any of the issues listed in the change log I strongly recommend moving from 3.8.3 to 3.8.4 beta to test and utilize the changes.
