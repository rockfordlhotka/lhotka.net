CSLA 4 version 4.5 release candidate 1 is now online via [installer](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/Download.aspx) and [nuget](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=csla).

This is a relatively minor update from the previous beta, with a small number of bug fixes. The big thing is that Tiago and Jonny put a lot of work into making sure the samples are all working with CSLA .NET 4.5.

My plan is to release version 4.5 by the middle of next week.
