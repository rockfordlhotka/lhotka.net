This is a cool site, that I hope takes off. In the words of its creator:


> <font face="Calibri" color="#000000" size="3">I wanted to drop you all a note about a project I’ve been working on called </font>[<font face="Calibri" size="3">Community Megaphone</font>](http://www.communitymegaphone.com/)<font face="Calibri" color="#000000" size="3">. Community Megaphone is a web site I started building about a year ago to fill what I saw as a need in the local community: simple, low-friction promotion and discovery of developer events, particularly community-run events. Initially, the site was limited to a portion of the east coast, but this week I’ve opened the site up to events from the entire United States. </font>


The need for some central location where you can find community events is high. While it is good that each event has its own web site for details and discussions, the value of a central index would be incredible! Please support Andrew's initiative!
