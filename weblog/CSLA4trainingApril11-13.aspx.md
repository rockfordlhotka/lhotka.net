Dunn Training is offering their [CSLA 4 training class](http://www.dunntraining.com/training/html/cslaframework4.htm) on April 11-13. The location is Atlanta.

Hereâ€™s a quote from their last class: "The willingness of our trainer to discuss how the material applied to our specific applications and situations allowed me to get an extraordinary amount of knowledge that I could put to real use immediately after taking the CSLA 4 training class."

This is a great class, so if you are looking for training on CSLA .NET, you should take a look at this opportunity.
