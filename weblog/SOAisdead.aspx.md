abstract: One of Don Box's predictions for 2005 is that the term "SOA" will die. Only to be reborn under a new name with better marketing.

Don Box put out his [predictions for 2005](http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2004/12/29/4113.aspx), including #3 which states that the term SOA will be replaced by some new hype-word invented by the marketing wonks of various software and industry analysis companies.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p>

As I said months ago, the [S in SOA is a dollar sign](/WeBlog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=05f88592-9ecb-4331-a86b-cfeebc411dfe). SOA is much more hype than reality, which means it is created and defined by marketing people far more than it is by actual computer scientists or engineers. <o:p></o:p>

As is often the case with over-hyped concepts, the terms related to those concepts rapidly become meaningless. What is SOA? Depends on which vendor you ask. What is a service? Depends on which vendor you ask. It is all a meaningless jumble here at the start of 2005.<o:p></o:p>

Of course the *concept* is too valuable to marketeers[1] for them to give up just because a term has been lost. So I am sure Don is right and marketing groups at Microsoft, IBM, Gartner and many other organizations are busily working to decide on the next term or terms to use for a while.<o:p></o:p>

So for better or worse SOA itself isn’t dead, but I agree that the term is living on borrowed time.<o:p></o:p>

[1] Yes, I know the term is marketers, but that extra “e” in there makes it sound so much more, well, Disney somehow :-)<o:p></o:p>
