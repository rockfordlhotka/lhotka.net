abstract: Here's a blog entry about an interesting blind political poll. What would happen if it were Java and .NET instead of Bush and Kerry?

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">My son&#8217;s 6<sup>th</sup> grade class recently did an exercise where they voted on the <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">US</st1:place></st1:country-region> presidential candidates based entirely on the issues and positions set forth by each candidate. But it was a blind poll &#8211; the kids didn&#8217;t know who was who. The results were surprising! </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Click here</font>](http://www.anomalousdata.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8814d74d-5eb4-4f65-88a4-3efbf58e59f1)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> for my wife&#8217;s write-up of the event and the parental reaction.</font>

<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">But it got me thinking. What would happen if you did the same thing with a room full of computer geeks, comparing the features put forth by different tools and technologies. Some ideas:</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

- <font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">Java vs .NET<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>
- <font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">VB vs C#<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>
- <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Web services vs Remoting</font>
- <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Web services vs DCOM</font>


<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">And the list goes on&#8230;</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">But seriously. It would be very interesting to see how people &#8220;voted&#8221; for a technology based purely on its stated feature set rather than on the largely subjective criteria we use in most cases.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">By largely subjective I mean, for instance, that most pro-.NET people choose it because it comes from Microsoft. Most Java people choose Java because it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">doesn&#8217;t</i> come from Microsoft. But if you did a blind poll, which would be chosen? I don&#8217;t know, but I think it would be an interesting exercise!</font>
