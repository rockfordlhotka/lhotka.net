I just upgraded this blog to the newest version of dasBlog. I upgraded my personal blog a few days ago and it has been trouble-free, so I thought it safe to upgrade this one. The only serious change you may see is when posting comments, as this new version requires that you type in a code from a graphic to help defeat posting bots. Kind of a pain, but worth it I suppose.

Of course I'm doing this just before leaving town for two weeks - first to Chicago and then to San Francisco for VS Live. Always a good time to upgrade ;)

The Chicago trip is primarily focused around working with a [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) client, but I'll be having some evening dinner meetings with various groups as well, including my first real foray into this fun new trend: a [Nerd Dinner](http://nerddinner.com/blogs/chicago/archive/2005/01/19/486.aspx).
