As track chair, it is my job to recruit speakers and help select sessions around software development and Windows Vista and .NET 3.0.

Windows Vista has some major impacts on software development. Perhaps most notably, having users (and developers) run in a non-Admin account affects how both development tools and end-user applications install and run. And then there are the new shell features, and integrated RSS support. Add to this .NET 3.0, with WCF, WPF, WF and WCS, and there's a lot of ground to cover.

If you would like to speak at VS Live in March, on a Windows Vista related topic, please use this [online proposal submission form](http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/callforpapers) to submit your idea.
