From a recent [MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/using/columns/wonders/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms09212004.asp) on UI design comes this little quote:


> “[...] We then discussed two types of UI designs—deductive and inductive. Generally speaking, the former puts the onus on the user to manage and learn a task, while the latter takes on the onus to guide the user through a task. The latter consequently turns out to be a great UI design choice for infrequently used tasks [...]”


I think this is very interesting, because I've seen numerous examples where an inductive UI was used for *frequently* performed tasks. And while these UIs look very cool, they are really, really inefficient if you have to use them very often...
