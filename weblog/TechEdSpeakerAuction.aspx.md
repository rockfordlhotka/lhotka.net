![](http://www.lhotka.net/images/aceh_teched.jpg) Several of the Tech Ed speakers (myself included) have donated an hour of our time to charity, and you can help!

Go to [http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5587400881](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5587400881)Â and bid for your speaker of choice.

The idea is that you'll get an hour of valuable time you can use to get questions answered or problems solved, and the money will go to a good cause.
