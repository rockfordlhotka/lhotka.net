Last year Magenic held a series of free one-day technical training events in cities around the US. These events were popular and successful, so we’re doing it again this year.

I am pleased to announce that our first event is [Code Mastery Boston](http://codemastery.com/boston/) on May 2 – so coming up soon!

These are FREE events, open to anyone wanting to get in-depth technical information. In Boston we have two tracks: .NET software development, and SQL Server/Business Intelligence.

I am delivering the keynote speech at the event, where I’ll be talking about the state of the Microsoft development platform and overall ecosystem. We are at an exciting point in the history of Microsoft, where yet again they are an underdog forced to innovate to overcome tough competition in the form of the iPhone/iPad devices, while also dealing with the commoditization of client computing, the emergence of HTML 5 as a real development platform, and the potential of cloud computing.

Our breakout sessions cover web, cloud, service, and Windows 8 software development, and SQL Server 2012, data warehousing, and business intelligence.

This is not an event to be missed, so if you are anywhere in the northeast it will be worth your time to spend the day with us at Code Mastery!
