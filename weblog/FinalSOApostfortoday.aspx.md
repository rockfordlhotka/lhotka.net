This is actually a shameless plug regarding me being quoted in the press...

In the very same [Enterprise Architect magazine](http://enterprisearchitect.texterity.com/enterprisearchitect/2004fall/) whose articleÂ I maligned in my [previous blog entry](/WeBlog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=2d5d57fe-ce13-42ed-a59a-f749e376cd1b)I am actually quoted in a different article. Check in the *Editors Note* and you'll find that Jim Fawcette does a good job of paraphrasing a statement I made about SOA during a discussion panel at VS Live in Orlando this fall.
