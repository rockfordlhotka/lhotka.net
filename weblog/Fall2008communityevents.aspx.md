[Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) a couple fall community events they are involved in organizing and/or sponsoring.

In Chicago there's the [Codeapalooza](http://www.codeapalooza.com/) event coming up on September 6. This is sponsored by Magenic and will have speakers from the whole community. It sounds like Justin Chase will be speaking at the event, talking about [UnitDriven](http://www.codeplex.com/UnitDriven) and the unit testing issues we've been facing while building CSLA Light (Justin is on the CSLA Light dev team).

Then in Minneapolis there's the [5th Twin Cities Code Camp](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx) on October 11. I'll be speaking at this event, talking about [CSLA Light](http://www.lhotka.net/cslalight) and [CSLA .NET](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet) 3.6. By that point CSLA Light should be well into its beta phase and will be a lot of fun to show (and see).
