Thanks to Russ Blair, there is now a time-based index for all the video segments in the [CSLA for Silverlight video series](http://download.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?t=SLVid01):

This index makes it much easier to find specific topics within the videos. As always, if youâ€™d like to buy the video series, please visit http://store.lhotka.net.
