One of my primary news sources is [The Morning Brew](http://blog.cwa.me.uk/2011/12/12/the-morning-brew-1000/) blog. I have it in my RSS reader, and I at least skim through every post.

It amazes me how Chris is able to pull together the key information every day – his dedication and the quality of his work are commendable.

If you are looking for an easy way to keep up on what’s going on in the Microsoft developer world, this is your source!
