We're really not that far away from some major new technology. Visual Studio "Orcas" is slated to ship this fall, and will include .NET 3.5; which includes new compilers. And new compilers always means fun! :)

The VB team is running a [series of webcasts](http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/archive/2007/04/09/live-from-redmond-webcast-series-beth-massi.aspx) to bring everyone up to speed on the language changes and the resulting capabilities.
