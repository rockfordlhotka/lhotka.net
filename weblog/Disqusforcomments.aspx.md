[![disqus-logo-blue-white](binary/Open-Live-Writer/Disqus-for-comments_C1E5/disqus-logo-blue-white_thumb.png "disqus-logo-blue-white")](binary/Open-Live-Writer/Disqus-for-comments_C1E5/disqus-logo-blue-white_2.png)I have switched this blog to use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/home/forum/rockfordlhotka) as a commenting system.

Disqus has modern commenting capabilities, good anti-spam, moderation (if necessary), and provides better performance and reliability than the old build-in dasBlog commenting system.

You’ll find the comments for each post in the post’s details page.
