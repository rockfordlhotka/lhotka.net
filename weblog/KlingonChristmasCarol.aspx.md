If you didn’t know, I’m an uber-geek in a family of uber-geeks, and that (of course) includes Star Trek, as well as supporting and being involved in the local fan community.

My wife is the fight choreographer for this play (and setting up fights with a batleth is really fun!). And the show itself is very good; good acting, well written script and a nice mix of action and comedy. It is a novel twist on an old story :)

*About the*[*Klingon Christmas Carol*](http://www.cbtheatre.org/KCC2009/KCC2009.htm)*:*

*Scrooge has no honor, nor any courage. Can three ghosts help him to become the true warrior he ought to be in time to save Tiny Tim from a horrible fate? Performed in the Original Klingon with English Supertitles, and narrative analysis from The Vulcan Institute of Cultural Anthropology.*

*The Dickens classic tale of ghosts and redemption adapted to reflect the Warrior Code of Honor and then translated into tlhIngan Hol  (That's the Klingon Language).*

*A co-production of Commedia Beauregard and the IKV RakeHell of the Klingon Assault Group.*

If you are in the upper-midwest region, I suggest you attend a show and see (according to the Klingons) the *original* Christmas Carol story.
