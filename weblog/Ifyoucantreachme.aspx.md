I use register.com for my email – though after today that may have to change…

Why? Because the register.com email service is down, and has been for several hours. There was a brief moment earlier this afternoon when I thought they had it fixed, because a few emails squeaked through, but otherwise it is deader than a doornail.

register.com is apparently doing some sort of email system upgrade – fancier AJAX web UI, etc. And that’d be fine, but all I really care about is reliable POP/SMTP service, and the “upgrade” appears to have been a major step backward in that regard…

This affects my personal email, the email for the [CSLA .NET forum](http://forums.lhotka.net/) and email for my [online store](http://store.lhotka.net/).

So if you sent me email and expect/need a response, don’t get your hopes too high. Maybe they’ll get it fixed, but I’m beginning to suspect that they really messed themselves up. This may be the push I need to explore other email options – probably ones that are cheaper and better (since register.com is not a great value in that regard – they are just convenient).
