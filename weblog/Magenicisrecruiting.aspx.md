[![magenic black square 143](binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Magenicisrecruiting_B821/magenic%20black%20square%20143_thumb.jpg "magenic black square 143")](binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Magenicisrecruiting_B821/magenic%20black%20square%20143_2.jpg) As long-time readers of my blog know, I’ve worked for [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) for along time – 14 years actually.

Who in our industry works for one company for that long? In my view this goes to show how good a company Magenic is as an employer.

Are you a .NET developer? If so, you are probably employed. Still, wouldn’t it be cool to work at a company like Magenic?

We are specifically recruiting for our Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco offices. If you are in SoCal or the Twin Cities we’re looking for good .NET and iOS developers there too.

And we have a traveling group, so if you live anywhere else and enjoy traveling elsewhere in the country we’d love to talk to you.
