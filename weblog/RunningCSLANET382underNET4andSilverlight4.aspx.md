Joost van Schaik spent some time figuring out how to get CSLA .NET 3.8.2 to work with Silverlight 4 – which takes a little effort because SL4 changes the way WCF proxies are referenced in the client config file. It is such an odd change that I rather suspect it might be a bug in SL4, but I guess we’ll see what happens as it gets closer to release.

He also wrote a nice blog post summarizing the steps required, which will probably be useful to a number of people:

Thank you Joost!
