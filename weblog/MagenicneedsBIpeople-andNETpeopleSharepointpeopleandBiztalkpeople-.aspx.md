Every now and then I plug [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) on my blog. This is because Magenic is a great consulting company, and I really feel good about encouraging people to come work here!

(Please note, I'm just another employee. People often think I own Magenic, but that's not true - I'm just lucky enough to work here :) )

Magenic has offices in Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco and Minneapolis, and all the offices really need good .NET developers, Sharepoint experts, Biztalk experts and Business Intelligence/SQL people.

What is spurring this particular post, is that our Chicago office has a particular need for a BI expert :)

But if you are a .NET developer - Windows, Web, VB, C# - please consider applying for a job at Magenic.

And if you are a Sharepoint or Biztalk expert, lucky you! Those technologies are hot (especially Sharepoint/MOSS), and we'd *love* to talk to you!

Finally, all our offices need BI expertise, not just Chicago.

If you want to work with some of the smartest and most dedicated people in the industry, you owe it to yourself to have a talk with one of our recruiters.
