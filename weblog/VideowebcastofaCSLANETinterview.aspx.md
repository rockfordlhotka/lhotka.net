Way back at Tech Ed last year I was interviewed by my friend Ted Neward. The topic is CSLA .NET, and the interview ranges all over the place, from architecture, to the origin of the "CSLA" acronym to some of my thoughts on service-oriented architecture. It was long enough that they broke it into two parts. You can view or download them using the links below.
