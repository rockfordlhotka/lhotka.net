[![csla_logo1_32](binary/Windows-Live-Writer/CSLA-4-version-4.1-release_110AA/csla_logo1_32_thumb.png "csla_logo1_32")](binary/Windows-Live-Writer/CSLA-4-version-4.1-release_110AA/csla_logo1_32_2.png)I am pleased to announce the release of CSLA .NET version 4.1 with support for .NET, Silverlight and Windows Phone 7 (WP7).

You can download CSLA 4 version 4.1 at http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx

Although there are numerous new features in version 4.1, the primary focus of this release is Windows Phone 7. With CSLA 4 version 4.1 you can now author business classes that run unchanged across the entire .NET platform:

- Windows Phone 7
- Silverlight
- WPF
- ASP.NET MVC
- ASP.NET Web Forms
- WCF services (SOAP and REST)
- asmx web services
- Windows Forms


The ability to reuse your business layer on .NET, Silverlight and WP7 is incredibly powerful, enabling you to extend your application to users on Windows, the web, and now the phone.

You can learn how to use CSLA 4 to build scalable, flexible, and maintainable applications through the [Using CSLA 4 ebook series](http://store.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?tabid=1560&amp;CategoryID=4&amp;List=1&amp;SortField=DateCreated+DESC%2cProductName&amp;Level=1&amp;ProductID=22). This ebook series is currently a work in progress and will be finished in the first half of 2011.
