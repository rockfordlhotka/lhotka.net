![](http://download.lhotka.net/images/csla_light_video.png) Segment 5 of the [CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series](http://store.lhotka.net) is now available. This segment covers all the CSLA .NET object stereotypes, including:

- Editable objects (single and list)
- Read-only objects (single and list)
- Name/value list
- Command
- Dynamic list (EditableRootListBase)
- etc


The focus is primarily on the business class structure and features, with some time spent discussing XAML data binding and the use of the CslaDataProvider and other UI controls.

This segment is 1:37 hours in length, yes, 97 minutes. The vast majority of this time is in Visual Studio, walking through code and providing information about class development that will be immediately useful to you.

Because segments 6 and 7 are not yet complete, I’m offering a [pre-release purchase offer](http://store.lhotka.net/) of **<font color="#800000" size="4">$50 off the regular price</font>** of $300. If you buy before June 20, your price is $250 for the entire video series, and you get the first five segments, over 5 hours of content, immediately!



Also, I’m looking for feedback. Most of the content in segment 5 (and in segment 6) applies to any user of CSLA .NET – Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, etc. Yes, there’s some Silverlight/XAML specific data binding discussion, but most of the video is focused on business class implementation.

If you are *not* a Silverlight developer, would you be interested in purchasing these two video segments even if some of the content didn’t apply to you? Let me know what you think, thanks!
