and a corresponding "Powered by" logo for web sites or applications that are built on CSLA .NET:

Note that the [CSLA .NET license](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/license.aspx) does *not* require any public display of this logo! But if you would like to use it to let people know that your application or site is built using CSLA .NET, that's wonderful! :)

Chris very kindly created a range of different sizes, and you can [download the entire set](http://www.lhotka.net/files/csla20/csla_logos.zip) in one zip file.
