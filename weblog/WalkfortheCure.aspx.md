Sue, my wife's best friend, and mother of my goddaughter, was diagnosed with breast cancer late last year. Fortunately they caught it early and with surgery and radiation she beat the cancer. It was a rough period of time, but she got through it.

Sue has convinced my wife to do a three day, 60 mile, Walk for the Cure this fall. It is a fundraiser for cancer research, and a worthy cause. I would think there must be better ways to raise money than to walk 20 miles a day for three days, but apparently not...

Here's my wife Teresa's[post about the walk](http://www.anomalousdata.com/Beautiful+Feat.aspx), including links to a web site where people (you perhaps?) can donate to the cause.

In fact, just to make it as easy as possible, here's the [direct link to the donation page](http://08.the3day.org/site/TR?px=2078421&amp;fr_id=1191&amp;pg=personal&amp;JServSessionIdr007=uq74uf3q11.app322a).

I rarely post personal items on my blog, preferring to keep it focused on cool technical stuff. But cancer is such an important issue. Sue beat it through good fortune and perseverance. My mother is living in an ongoing battle against a different type of cancer. A battle that appears unwinnable, and which has altered our lives dramatically over the past few years.

Any help in raising money for this cancer research effort is most appreciated! Thank you!
