<font size="4">The <em>CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook</em> is available NOW at </font>[<font color="#99aa99" size="4">http://store.lhotka.net</font>](http://store.lhotka.net/)<font size="4"> for both C# and VB.</font>

Additionally, version 2.1.3 of CSLA .NET is now available for download from [<font color="#99aa99">this location</font>](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

Version 2.1.3 includes some bug fixes and minor enhancements. The enhancements are primarily around the CslaDataSource web control, which now provides more integrated support for paging and sorting.

Most importantly, version 2.1.3 is the specific version described in my *CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook*. I am releasing this as a ~160 page ebook, available in editions for both C# and VB, for purchase directly from my web site.

This new book is best thought of as a sequel to my my *Expert C# 2005 Business Objects*and *Expert VB 2005 Business Objects*books. It covers the changes made since CSLA .NET 2.0 was released: how the framework has changed, and how to use the new features and capabilities. Please note that this *is not a replacement* for those books: it expands on them.

I hope you enjoy CSLA .NET 2.1.3, and the new book. Thank you, code well, have fun!
