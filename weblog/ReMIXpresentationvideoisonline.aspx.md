Earlier this week I co-presented a session at ReMIX in Boston, with Anthony Handley, a fellow [Magenicon](http://www.magenic.com). Anthony is a User Experience Specialist, and the two of us have been working on a WPF/Silverlight project (that also happens to use CSLA .NET of course :) ) and in this presentation we discussed our experiences using WPF from the perspectives of a developer and a designer.

Here are the links to the video of the session.
