[![VS Live San Francisco](/images/vslivesf05.jpg)](http://www.vslive.com/)I will be speaking at VS Live San Francisco, Feb 6-10, 2005.

As part of the event, I'll be doing a full day pre-con workshop covering distributed object-oriented archtiecture, design and programming concepts based on the concepts and code from my Business Objects books. This means that the workshop not only provides a lot of good theory, but also very practical demonstrations on how to apply that theory using the CSLA .NET framework. I will not only cover the framework as described in the books, but also all the enhancements to the framework since that point - including the most recent enhancements present in version 1.5 of the framework.
