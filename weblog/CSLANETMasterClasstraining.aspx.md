Dunn Training has been offering a very good 3 day class on CSLA .NET for some time now, with lots of great feedback. And this class continues (with a sold-out class coming up in Toronto).

As a compliment to that class, Dunn is now lining up a bigger and deeper 5 day master class. The plan is to have just two of these each year.

This master class is quite different from the 3 day class. It will have more lecture, deeper labs and a faster pace. They tell me the intent is to cover everything from OO design to CSLA object creation to WPF/Windows/Web/WCF/WF interface design to LINQ in one intense week.

Not only will this be the ultimate in CSLA .NET training, it'll be some incredibly awesome training on .NET itself!!
