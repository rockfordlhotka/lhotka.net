I am pleased to announce the final release of CSLAÂ 4 version 4.5 with support for the following platforms:

- .NET 4.5
- Windows Runtime (WinRT)
- .NET 4
- Silverlight 5


The new release is available via [nuget](http://nuget.org/packages?q=csla) and the [CSLA download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

This release includes a number of important features and changes, including:

- Support for Windows Runtime (WinRT), so you can simply recompile your existing CSLA .NET business classes for WinRT with little or no changes required to migrate to the new platform
- Support for the new async and await keywords in .NET 4.5 (and in .NET 4 and SL5 via the async targeting pack)
- Enhancements to the business rules engine
- Enhancements to Windows Forms support via the Csla.Windows namespace


The entire CSLA .NET dev team has put a lot of work into this release, and we hope you enjoy it and find it useful!
