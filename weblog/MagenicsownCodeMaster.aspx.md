If you go to http://www.microsoft.com/net/dotnetstories/ youâ€™ll see many compelling stories of people using Microsoft .NET to do cool things.

This includes Andy Schwartz, a colleague of mine at Magenic. Andy is not only a great technologist, but he has a couple real black belts in martial arts.

I love working with such great people! :)
