I have put an updated pre-release online for download of both CSLA .NET 3.6 and CSLA Light 3.6.

- [CSLA .NET](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx)
- [CSLA Light](http://www.lhotka.net/cslalight/download.aspx)


We're now at the point of focusing primarily on stabilization and limiting new features. Changes at this point will be due to our testing and usage, and feedback we recieve from the community.

This pre-release should be reasonably stable, on both the .NET and Silverlight platforms. Please give them a try and post in [the forum](http://forums.lhotka.net) with any issues you encounter. Thank you!
