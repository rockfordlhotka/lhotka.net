VS Live Las Vegas is coming up soon, and as a speaker I am able to provide a special discount code – kind of a perk for you reading my blog I guess :)

If you register for VS Live using code **<font color="#ff0000">S9V03</font>** you’ll get the all-access passport package for $400 off the standard price.

The conference has great content for developers, covering core .NET, VSTS/TFS, Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET, Azure, Oslo and more. VS Live is one of the most respected independent technical conferences in the Microsoft space.

I’ll be talking about parallel and concurrent programming (from a practical, real-world perspective), techniques you can use to deal with the rapid pace of change in technology, and giving a workshop on building distributed applications using .NET 3.5 SP1 (so WPF, Silverlight, WCF, Windows Workflow – and of course a liberal dose of [CSLA .NET](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet)).

As a nice bonus, the conference has a block of rooms at the Venetian Hotel for $99/night. This is one of the nicest hotels in Vegas, and normally you couldn’t touch a room for anywhere near this rate!
