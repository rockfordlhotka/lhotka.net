Here's a link to a [preliminary list of sessions](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Fall2007/Sessions.aspx) for the upcoming Twin Cities code camp. [Jason](http://www.jasonbock.net/) needs a few more speakers to fill out the schedule though, so if you are in the Twin Cities area and would like to present on any developer related topic (business, non-business, Microsoft, non-Microsoft - it doesn't matter!) you can find [contact information here](http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx).
