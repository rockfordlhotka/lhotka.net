[VS Live](http://www.vslive.com) is coming to New York in September and Las Vegas in October. I'll be speaking at both events, including a pre-con workshop covering architecture and design considerations for .NET 2.0 through 3.5 - kind of a survival guide to the many versions of .NET :)

Of course I use CSLA .NET and CSLA Light to illustrate some of the techniques you can use to minimize your risk and lower your costs as you migrate from Windows Forms to WPF or Silverlight, and from Web Forms to ASP.NET MVC or Silverlight. At the same time, I spend a lot of time talking about most of the various technologies available - my use of CSLA is incidental rather than central to the talk.

1105 Media (the people who run VS Live) put together this promo video for the show - I'm in the middle of it for a bit.

VS Live is a great show - I hope to see some of you in one of these cities!
