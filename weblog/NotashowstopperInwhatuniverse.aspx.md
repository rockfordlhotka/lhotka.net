<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">In the January 2, 2006 edition of InfoWorld there’s a short article about the recent release of MySQL 5.0. I’ve used MySQL, and there are even people building CSLA .NET based applications with MySQL backend databases. Kudos!</font>

<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">But the article makes this comment about the new stored procedure support in MySQL:</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">“The stored procedures were generally stable in my tests, but this being MySQL’s first implementation, there were a few bugs. For example, I had some trouble with the server freezing up when I tried to open some of my larger procedures. Although not a show-stopper, this behavior could be a problem if you have a busy database.”</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I had to read this several times to be sure I had it right. The “server freezing up” is “not a show-stopper”?!?</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Suppose Oracle or SQL Server would “freeze up” when you opened a large stored procedure? On a busy database or not I’m guessing no sane person would say that this was “not a show-stopper”.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">It is not a show-stopper because the expectations of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">released</i> open source (<?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city>) product just aren’t in the same league with “real” software? If so, then <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city> really is just a joke. But I don’t buy this argument, because MySQL is used as “real” software by many companies, and thus it should be held to the same standard as any other database engine out there.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Or is it not a show-stopper because of media bias? Because the media tends to cut <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city> slack they’d never <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">dream</i> of cutting proprietary software? Because if they scrutinized OSS software at the same level they do proprietary software everyone would see just how little difference “open” really makes in terms of quality or security?</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I think this latter argument holds a lot more water. Americans like the underdog, and <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city> is the underdog compared to any proprietary system out there. So the media throws objectivity out the window and cuts them a break. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city> is held to a lower standard, even so far as that having your database server freeze up is a trivial concern.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">What a shame, since this sort of reporting will ultimately be a lead weight around the ankles of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city>. <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">OSS</st1:place></st1:city> will never get real respect unless it is treated as being in the same league with the rest of the software in the world. And that starts with the media…</font></font></font>
