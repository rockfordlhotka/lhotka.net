CSLA 4 version 4.2 beta 2 is now available for download on the [CSLA download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

This beta update includes a small number of bug fixes, and some enhancements:

1. The Windows Phone projects now build for WP 7.5 "Mango"
2. Csla.Xaml.PropertyInfo can now be used in a control template
3. MobileFormatter can now be used for undo/clone operations on .NET
4. Samples are now built against the 4.2 assemblies
5. Several WPF/SL samples now use PropertyInfo, and have been styled to look better (thanks Aaron!)


At this point I expect the 4.2 release to occur by the end of November. There may or may not be another beta release depending on your feedback with this beta.
