Most people are aware of [DotNetRocks](http://www.dotnetrocks.com). But fewer people are aware that the talent behind DotNetRocks has started a new venture: [DNR TV](http://www.dnrtv.com). It is kind of like DotNetRocks, only with live video of the computer screen during the conversation. I recently recorded two episodes on CSLA .NET 2.0 for DNR TV:

- [CSLA .NET 2.0 Part 1](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showID=12)
- [CSLA .NET 2.0 Part 2](http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx?showID=13)


Look for more DNR TV episodes on CSLA .NET 2.0 in the future.
