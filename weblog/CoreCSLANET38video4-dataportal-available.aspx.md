The 4th video in the Core CSLA .NET 3.8 video series (available from http://store.lhotka.net) is now online. If you’ve already purchased the series, you can download the new video from the [download page](http://download.lhotka.net/Default.aspx?t=Core38).

Video 4 covers the data portal and how you can use it for 1-, 2- and 3-tier deployments of your applications. This is 1:53 hours of in-depth content, providing an overview of the data portal concept, and an extensive walk-through of code using the data portal. You’ll see how to configure the client, set up and configure a server – all using WCF. Even better, you’ll see various object patterns that leverage the data portal, including the powerful unit of work pattern.

The special pre-release pricing is still in effect for this amazing video series. Buy before the end of the year and get 33% off the regular $300 price. That’s right – [buy now](http://store.lhotka.net/) for just $200.

And while you are at the store, take a look at the CSLA .NET for Silverlight video series, which is 15% off until the end of 2009. If you are using CSLA .NET to build Silverlight applications, this video series will get you up and running – from creating your first Silverlight project in Visual Studio 2008, through implementing the UI, the business objects and data access, everything you need to know is in this one series of videos.
