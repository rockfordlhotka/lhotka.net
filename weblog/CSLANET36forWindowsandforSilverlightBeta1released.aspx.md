Version 3.6 Beta 1 of [CSLA .NET for Windows](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx) and [CSLA .NET for Silverlight](http://www.lhotka.net/cslalight/download.aspx) is now available.

The new Silverlight version requires Silverlight 2.0 RC0.

Our focus in the last couple pre-releases has been stability, and this is true for Beta 1 as well. There are no new features in this release, just some fixes for reported issues, and of course making sure the code works with Silverlight RC0.

Please report any issues you find on the forums at http://forums.lhotka.net, thank you!
