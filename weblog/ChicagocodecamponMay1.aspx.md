I’ll be at the [Chicago code camp](http://chicagocodecamp.com/) this coming Saturday, May 1.

I’ll be talking about CSLA 4, walking through the new business, validation and authorization rules features, along with many of the other new features in version 4 (like the new LINQ support, ASP.NET MVC components, XAML components, etc).

If you are in the Chicago area, I encourage you to come to the code camp – there are a lot of good speakers and it will be a great time!

Also, on May 1 is the [Iowa code camp](http://iowacodecamp.com/), and at least a couple people from Magenic (Jason Bock and Brent Edwards) will be speaking at that event.
