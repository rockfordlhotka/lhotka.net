Microsoft has just opened up a new [online training site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/elearning) with free training. They are calling it an eLearning site. It is hard to beat free training!



Better yet, in an effort to get people to try the training, they have a contest running where you can win some really cool prizes. Personally I'm shooting for the 50" HDTV :)



Unfortunately thus far they only have one course up - on 64 bit computing. Having gone through the 32 to 64 bit switch under OpenVMS 15 years ago, I can't say I'm overly excited. But they promise to have more courses on more interesting areas including Smart Client, Connected Systems, SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.
