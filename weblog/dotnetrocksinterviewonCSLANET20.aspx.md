That was fast! Just this past weekend I was in New London, CT and did a live-in-the-studio interview for [dotnetrocks on CSLA .NET 2.0](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=172). Somehow I thought it would air in a week or two, but just like that it is online and ready to hear!

While I was there I also recorded two episodes for DNR TV - the new dotnetrocks initiative that includes video of the computer screen. In those programs I walked through the basic structure of an editable root object and discussed how to bind it to a Windows Forms interface. If you want a quick intro into the use of CSLA .NET these should be well worth watching when they become available.
