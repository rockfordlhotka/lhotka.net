Know CSLA .NET? Looking for a job with a cool company?

Magenic is hiring CSLA developers for consulting work, so if you want to work for a great company, with some really fun and smart people, often using CSLA, you should contact one of our recruiters!



p.s. Magenic is also open to working with independent contractors through a subcontract agreement, so let us know if you are interested in that as well, thanks!
