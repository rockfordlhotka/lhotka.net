A few weeks ago I [posted](http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/CSLAIntoTheFuture.aspx) what was basically a request for input on one aspect of the future of CSLA .NET. I got a lot of really thoughtful and useful feedback and input from that post (and a [related thread](http://forums.lhotka.net/forums/thread/25723.aspx) in the forum). I've also been discussing this with Apress and other colleagues, and I've come to a decision.

Starting with version 3.6, CSLA .NET for Windows and CSLA .NET for Silverlight will be maintained in C# only. This will allow me to focus more of my energies on improving the framework, and on providing resources and materials on how to use the framework (in both C# and VB).

In the short term this means continuing to finalize version 3.6 and to finish *Expert C# 2008 Business Objects* (current availability target is December).

*However*, I am willing to take some people up on their offer to help maintain the VB version of the framework, if those offers still stand. The idea would be to have the community keep the VB code base in sync with the C# code base as it evolves - at least for CSLA .NET for Windows.

And here's a possible incentive. If the VB code can be brought up to sync by mid-December or so, I will work with Apress to create *Expert VB 2008 Business Objects* following the C# edition of the book. I really can't do that book in VB unless the framework exists in VB, but if that can happen then I'm pretty sure we can make the book happen shortly thereafter.

Contributors will need to sign a contributor agreement, to keep everything clear and legal. And they'll use the current subversion repository and issue tracking database, so I think it should be a pretty smooth arrangement. And obviously contributors will have the undying gratitude of the community :)

If you are interested in making this happen, please email me - rocky (at) lhotka dot net - and we'll go from there.

I think this should be a good overall solution, hopefully making everyone happy in both the short and long term.
