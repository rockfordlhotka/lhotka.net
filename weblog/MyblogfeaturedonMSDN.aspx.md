The [MSDN VB community site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/community/) has featured my blog - which I think is pretty cool.

For those who don't know, the VB team at Microsoft has started assemblying a community portal site for VB developers at http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/community/.

They already have some cool content, including relevant blog listings, links to sites with useful code, tips and tricks and so forth. And they plan to do more in the near future, including some more interactive content so we, as the community, can help create and manage some of the site's content.

I think this is an excellent step on the part of the VB team to help support the huge VB community, and I appreciate it. Thanks guys!
