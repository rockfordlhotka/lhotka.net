I consider myself a strong ally for diversity in technology in general, and women in technology more specifically. I work to improve matters through my role as CTO at Magenic, as a conference chair for VS Live and Modern Apps Live, through my social media channels, and in any other way I can.

Today this tweet came through my feed from [@CallbackWomen](https://twitter.com/callbackwomen):

![](binary/Finding%20women%20tech%20speakers%20is%20really%20difficult/snip_20161202112837.png)

The idea of a conference giving out Playboy magazines in their welcome pack is surreal, and clearly violates the spirit (and I think the letter) of their own [code of conduct](http://dcmuc16.drupalcamp.de/en/code-conduct).

I do want to pick a nit with the tweet regarding the lack of diversity in the speaker lineup though. I agree there's a problem with a lack of diversity in their lineup - and the lineups of nearly every tech conference out there.

But as a conference chair I can say that finding women to speak at tech conferences is *really hard*. This is something I've been trying to overcome for years now, and have solicited help and input from female colleagues, other allies like myself (such as [John Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com/), friends, random people on twitter (like the [@CallbackWomen](https://twitter.com/callbackwomen) community and others), and speakers at conferences specifically about diversity in tech (such as [AlterConf](https://www.alterconf.com/) where it is easy to find women speakers).

If I look at VS Live and Modern Apps Live in particular, we've done things like create and actively enforce an [anti-harassment policy](https://vslive.com/pages/harassment.aspx), and many attempts to reach out to various online communities focused on women speakers in tech. This is ongoing over the past several years, so not a recent thing or a one-time thing.

The result, over all this time, has been new submission from women to our [CFP process](http://cfp.vslive.com). And we had her speak and she was excellent.

**What I'd like from this post**

What I'd like to see from this post is perhaps a broader conversation and input on ways to bring in more submissions from women speakers to tech conference call for presentations/speakers/papers. As conference chairs we can't increase diversity in our speaker lineups if no women even submit to speak.

If you are a woman in technology, do you speak? If so, how do we attract your attention?

If are a woman in tech and you don't speak (but would like to), how can we encourage you to speak? Or help you develop speaking skills? Are there gender-specific blockers that are preventing you from becoming part of the speaker community?

And there *is* a speaker community by the way. Well, I'm sure there are many different such communities. In the Microsoft app dev tech space there's a large and vibrant speaker community. And this community has *some* diversity, including some extremely accomplished women. But the number is so small that I believe I know *all* of them, and count most as friends. I don't know all the men in the community, because there are too many. That highlights the issue in a sense.

So again, what I'd love to see is a conversation about what it is that prevents accomplished women technologists who are public speakers from submitting to conferences like VS Live? And what prevents women technologists who *want to become speakers* from pursuing that avenue?
