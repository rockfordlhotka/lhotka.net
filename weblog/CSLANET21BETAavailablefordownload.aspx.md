I just updated the download page (http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx) to make the BETA version of CSLA .NET 2.1 available.

Make sure you read the Change Log document before going too far. I've tried to list all breaking changes as a summary at the top, with my estimate on the likely impact of each one. You can find more details further into the document.

There will be no more functional changes to 2.1, so this download is complete. There obviously could be bugs, but enough people have been helping me find issues with the last couple pre-releases that I think it is pretty stable at this point.

Barring anyone finding a major issue, I am still planning to release 2.1 by the end of September, so if you have any near-term plans to use 2.1 I *strongly* recommend trying this beta version *on a non-production copy* of your project over the next 10 days or so. That will allow you to provide me with any bug reports in enough time that I can try and address them.
