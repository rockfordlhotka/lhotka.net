CSLA 4 version 4.2 is now released and available for download.

- [CSLA download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx)
- [NuGet](http://nuget.org/List/Search?packageType=Packages&amp;searchCategory=All+Categories&amp;searchTerm=csla)


The primary focus of this release is the introduction of support for mono (Mac, Linux), monotouch (iPhone, iPad), and mono for Android.

This version also supports Windows Phone “Mango” (SDK version 7.1).

You can now reuse your business code across .NET, Silverlight, Windows Phone, and these newly supported platforms as well. As demand grows to build applications that must work on various mobile devices, the ability to directly reuse your business classes is compelling!

Version 4.2 also includes a number of enhancements to the existing CSLA 4 rule engine, along with various other features and bug fixes. Check out the [change log](http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=2607a4ef-e6a9-4801-aa0b-518c51267339) for more information.

Our next step is to provide support for Silverlight 5 in CSLA 4 version 4.3, followed by support for WinRT (Windows 8) in version 4.5. The expectation is that your existing CSLA-based business classes will continue to work in Silverlight 5 and WinRT, providing even more long-term reuse, maintainability, and cost-effective development.
