One of the perks of working for Magenic is that Greg and Paul (the owners) give all employees a tech gift at the end of each year.

Past gifts have included Tivo units, Xbox consoles (with and without Kinect over time), GPS units, Kindle readers, you get the idea.

This yearâ€™s tech gift: a [Kindle Fire](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Fire-Amazon-Tablet/dp/B0051VVOB2) with a one year Amazon Prime subscription.

Magenicons work hard to do great work for our customers, and this is one way the company shows its appreciation for that dedication. Thank you Greg and Paul, and thanks to all the Magenic employees that make the company a great place to work!
