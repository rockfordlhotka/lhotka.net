You’ve probably noticed that Microsoft released Silverlight 3 today. More information can be found at

I’ve put a very stable beta of CSLA .NET 3.7 online as well

Version 3.7 is really the same code as 3.6.3, but it builds with the Silverlight 3 tools for Visual Studio 2008. So while I’m calling it a beta, it is really release-quality code for all intents and purposes.

If you are a Windows/.NET user of CSLA .NET, you’ll find that all future bug fixes, enhancements and so forth will be in version 3.7. Version 3.6.3 is the last 3.6 version.

If you are a Silverlight user of CSLA .NET, and continue to use the Silverlight 2 tools, 3.6.x is still for you, but I plan to address only the most critical bugs in that version – and I’m not currently aware of anything at that level. So 3.6.3 is really the end for Silverilght 2 as well.

In short, 3.7 is now the active development target for any real work, and you should plan to upgrade to it when possible.
