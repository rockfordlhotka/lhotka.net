If you are looking for CSLA .NET classroom training, this is a great opportunity. Here’s a quote from a student who attended the December class:

“*Dunn’s CSLA training was phenomenal!!! It significantly advanced our team’s knowledge of CSLA and helped layout the roadmap for our future development. Mark Berry  holistically demonstrated how CSLA works with MVVM, Silverlight, WPF, Expression, OO Programming and Code Generators. He also successfully answered extremely challenging CSLA questions that were thrown at him during class. Our team is pretty knowledgeable with CSLA and the other technologies, but Mark took us to an entirely new level, sprinkled in some nice tips, tied it all together, and reenergized our team. The training was well worth the money.*”
