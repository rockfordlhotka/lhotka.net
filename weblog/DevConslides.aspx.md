I have put the slides from my DevCon talks online:

- [PRODEV04 – Distributed Architecture](http://www.lhotka.net/files/devcon/PRODEV04-Lhotka-Architecture.pdf)
- [VS01 – Build a Mobile App with CSLA](http://www.lhotka.net/files/devcon/VS01-Lhotka-MobileApp.pdf)
- [VS02 – Unit Testing Across Platforms](http://www.lhotka.net/files/devcon/VS02-Lhotka-Testing.pdf)


The demos I used in these talks are all part of the CSLA 4 version 4.2 download, or the related Samples download. All are on the [CSLA download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

If you would like more information about CSLA .NET, visit the [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/faq/) page, or look at the [ebooks and videos](http://store.lhotka.net/) available from my store.
