The FCC has decided to [allow phone companies to screw us](http://news.com.com/2061-10785_3-5820294.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5820294&amp;subj=news) consumers over just like cable companies do. They really should have gone the other way and forced cable to be more like DSL.

It will be interesting to see what my particular phone company does, as I've been with the same ISP for many years. Now I could be forced to switch to my phone company. Odds of them allowing static IP addresses are probably about as good as with cable - which is to say not good...

In short, the FCC probably just costed me several hundred dollars a year either in buying a hosting service for all my domains and sites, or in buying my phone company's corporate level service which is a *lot* more expensive than my current ISP.

If it comes to that though, at least I'll get faster service. Our cable company provides a lot faster connectivity and my DSL, and if I'm going to have to pay super-high rates to get a static IP address I'd rather go with cable and get the faster speeds...

While the current goverment might be against raising taxes, they certainly seem to be happy to help corporations get more of our money...

Update: Here's an [actual news article](http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20050805/ap_on_go_ot/fcc_broadband) on the topic as well.
