[![csla win8_compact](binary/Open-Live-Writer/Starting-the-process-of-switching-to-a-s_8EE9/csla%20win8_compact_thumb.png "csla win8_compact")](binary/Open-Live-Writer/Starting-the-process-of-switching-to-a-s_8EE9/csla%20win8_compact_2.png)I am strongly considering switching CSLA from its current open source (but one-off) license to a standard OSS license such as MS-PL.

I do not believe this will impact anyone except in a positive way.

The new license will grant at least as many rights to you as the current license. The primary difference is that the current license includes a clause restricting you from taking CSLA and repackaging it into a "CSLA competitor".

I think the odds of anyone doing that today are small, and I think the value to everyone of using a standard OSS license outweighs the minor protections my existing license provides me.

It is also important to understand that this new license will affect the version where I make the change and into the future. So there will be *absolutely zero* impact on any existing versions of CSLA - they will continue to be available under the existing license.

To get the new license people will need to upgrade to the new version of CSLA, and to avoid the new license people will just need to never upgrade to a newer version of CSLA.
