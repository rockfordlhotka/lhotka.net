Next week, on 21 November, I'm speaking at a user group in Barcelona. I'll be giving an overview of CSLA .NET 3.0, with a little glimpse of 3.5 if I have time.

The organizers have also arranged for this to be broadcast as a Live Meeting. The link for registering and assisting to the live meeting session is: [http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360496&Culture=es-ES](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360496&amp;Culture=es-ES)
