**The Twin Cities XNA User Group is hosting a very special event next month...**

They're hosting a huge Halo 3 Tournament at Microsoft to raise money for **Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota**. They will also have Rock Band 2 and a few standalone machines for people to check out XNA Community Games.

Even if you aren't a gamer, you probably know one. You might even have one in your family. This is an excellent cause worth donating to, and best of all: **[Magenic](http://www.magenic.com/) is matching funds raised by the event (up to the first $3000)!! **

For more information, and to register (or just donate), please visit http://www.charityfragathon.com
