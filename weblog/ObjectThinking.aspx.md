<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">As I noted in a previous entry, I rarely read computer books. However, there are exceptions.</font>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">People often ask me to suggest good books on object-oriented design. I struggle with this. I have a whole shelf of what I consider to be pretty crappy OO design books. Sure, each of them has a tidbit here and there, but on the whole I wasted a lot of money building a collection of books that sits there gathering dust.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The one book I&#8217;ve consistently recommended is </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">David Taylor&#8217;s &#8220;Object Technology: A Manager&#8217;s Guide&#8221;</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201309947)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">. This is an absolute must-read for anyone hoping for success with OO design or programming. Yes, I know it has the dread word &#8220;manager&#8221; in the title, but don&#8217;t let that scare you off. Go buy and read the book. It is not only a delightful read (which is saying a lot for a computer book), but it is full of great ideas and information and ways of thinking.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I just got a new book that I expect will be a favorite. I&#8217;m only a bit into it, but I&#8217;m so enthused that I&#8217;m blogging now rather than waiting for the (sure to be climactic) end of the book.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The book is </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Object Thinking by David West</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619654)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">. Many years ago Mr. West taught college here in <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:state>, and we brought him in to do a multi-day OO design class at the consulting company where I worked. While all of us in the class agreed that his ideas were a bit flakey, the class was absolutely full of great ideas, concepts and approaches.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">This book promises to be the same as that class. Mr. West doesn&#8217;t pull any punches. He really believes in what he&#8217;s presenting, and presents it in a clear and easy to read manner. Sure, the ideas push the limits of what most people consider practical, but they are truly great ideas and deserve serious consideration.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">The book reflects a lot of what I talk about in my speaking around the world. This isn&#8217;t surprising, since that class years ago certainly influenced my thinking in some very fundamental ways.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">This includes ideas like anthropomorphism &#8211; where you endow objects with human-like qualities. I do this all the time in my work, and those that have heard me speak know that I do it all the time with objects, computers, networks and all sorts of things. There is tremendous value in giving inanimate entities a voice of their own, as long as you listen to what they say!</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">And this is the thing. My last statement there sounds flakey. Heck, it is flakey. Mr. West is full of this sort of thing. Don&#8217;t let it put you off. I mean it. I&#8217;m not much for flakey stuff, but it turns out that some of the flakey-sounding ideas he puts forward are directly useful &#8211; at least of you want to do actual object-oriented design.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">On a bit of a tangent, Mr. West also tends to use the English language well. This includes using complex words and expressing complex concepts. I love this stuff. My absolute favorite author is </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Neal Stephenson</font>](http://www.nealstephenson.com/)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">, mostly because of his absolute mastery of language and imagery. Most computer books (including </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">mine</font>](/Publications.aspx)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">) get edited so they&#8217;ll be easier to translate to various other human languages &#8211; thus gaining a larger market. While that makes economic sense, it is a truly unfortunate thing, because it guts our ability to use deep language constructs and vocabulary to accurately and viscerally express the concepts we&#8217;re discussing.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I am always saying that objects are about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">behavior</i>, not data. Mr. West has written a book that&#8217;s all about understanding that fundamental truth. Get this idea, internalize it, become one with it and you&#8217;ll be well on your way to really doing OO design.</font>
