The release version of CSLA .NET version 2.1.4 is now available for download from [**www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx**](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

This version addresses a set of ongoing issues with the CslaDataSource control for web development. Thanks to Andr√©s Villanueva, who put in a lot of work, the control is now able to find business types reliably as you rebuild your solution over time. Additionally, you can now put business classes directly in your web project and use them (though I don't encourage this, as it breaks down good layering of your application).

Other than the changes to CslaDataSource, version 2.1.4 is documented by the *CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook* available from [**<font color="#800080">http://store.lhotka.net</font>**](http://store.lhotka.net/), and of course by my [**Expert C# 2005 Business Objects**](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet) and [**Expert VB 2005 Business Objects**](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet) books.
