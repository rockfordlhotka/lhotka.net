A public beta of CSLA .NET 2.0 is now available at http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/csla20.aspx

The Expert C# 2005 Business Objects and Expert VB 2005 Business Objects books are still due out around the end of March. That is also the point at which the framework with "RTM".

The public beta should be reasonable stable. I am nearly done with technical reviews of the chapters, and so am basically done with the framework updates. The ProjectTracker sample application is still under review at this point.
