![MCM-logo-s.jpg](https://github.com/HTBox/MobileKidsIdApp/blob/master/resources/MCM-logo-s.jpg?raw=true)Over the past few months a group of us have been working on a [Mobile Kids Id Kit app](https://github.com/HTBox/MobileKidsIdApp/) for [Humanitarian Toolbox](http://www.htbox.org/) and [Missing Children Minnesota](http://missingchildrenmn.com/).

We’re nearing the point of an MVP release and think we’ll get there with one good day of work – that day is this **Saturday, August 27**.

The location will be in Eden Prairie, MN. Please consider joining us if you are in the area and have skills in any of these areas:

- Xamarin mobile development
- Xamarin Forms XAML themes or styles
- Hockeyapp
- Microsoft Azure web site development (ASP.NET)


This app will support iOS, Android, and Windows. It will provide parents with a valuable tool to help them in the unfortunate possibility that their child goes missing.

How often do you have a chance to apply your software development or design skills to directly and literally make the world a better place? This is your chance!

If you are already part of the development team, full details are on our Slack channel. If you are not yet part of the team, we welcome your help! Please provide me with your email address in a comment on this post or via one of the my social media channels at https://about.me/rockfordlhotka and I’ll get you looped into the team.

*Oh yeah, and because it is summer in Minnesota, this codeathon will also be a BBQ with typical summer grillables provided!*

Or, if you have the skills and time, but aren't in the Twin Cities area you can still participate in the codeathon, but you'll have to provide your own summer BBQ while you work from wherever you are :)

In other words, we have all sorts of remote collaboration technologies, the code is in GitHub - so anyone in the world should feel free to get involved!
