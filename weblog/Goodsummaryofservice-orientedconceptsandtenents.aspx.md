[Here is a good summary](http://www.ebpml.org/soa.htm) of service-oriented concepts and tenents.

The only quibble I have is that the first section of the document combines SOA and web services into a unified concept. I think this is too limiting, but at the same time it is workable, since services *do imply* a design that may be distributed. Whether you use web services or some other technology to do the distribution, the fact is that the principles listed in the document will apply.
