For those that don't know, I live in the Twin Cities area: Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.

This evening one of the major bridges crossing the Mississippi River collapsed. It is a horrible disaster. The kind of thing that you simply hope never to see.

My family and I are fine. We've called our friends who might have been affected and they are fine.

My heart goes out to the people who were caught in this disaster, and their families and friends.
