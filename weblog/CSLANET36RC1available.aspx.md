[CSLA .NET for Windows](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet) and [CSLA .NET for Silverlight](http://www.lhotka.net/cslalight) version 3.6 RC1 are now available for download.

The [Expert C# 2008 Business Objects](http://www.amazon.com/Expert-C-2008-Business-Objects/dp/1430210192) book went to the printer on November 24 and should be available very soon.

I'm working to have a final release of 3.6 as quickly as possible. The RC1 release includes a small number of bug fixes based on issues reported through the [CSLA .NET forum](http://forums.lhotka.net/). Barring any show-stopping bug reports over the next few days, I expect to release version 3.6 on December 15.

If you intend to use version 3.6, please download this release candidate and let me know if you encounter any issues. Thank you!
