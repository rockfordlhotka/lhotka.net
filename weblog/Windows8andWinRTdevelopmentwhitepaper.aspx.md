I have been working with some of my colleagues at Magenic to write a whitepaper that summarizes our view on how “Windows 8” and WinRT affect existing Microsoft developers.

If you’ve read my previous [WinRT related blog posts](http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/Windows8BlogSummary.aspx) you’ll see that the whitepaper is similar, but provides more formal analysis and information in a presentable format.
