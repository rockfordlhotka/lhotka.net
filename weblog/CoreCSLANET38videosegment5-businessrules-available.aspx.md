Part 5 of the Core CSLA .NET 3.8 video series is now available from the [download page](http://download.lhotka.net/default.aspx?t=Core38).

This video segment covers business and validation rules in CSLA .NET. This includes discussion of the .NET DataAnnotations attributes, along with synchronous and asynchronous rule methods, rule priorities, short-circuiting and a whole lot more.

The business and validation rule subsystem is one of the most important and compelling features of CSLA .NET, and even seasoned users of the framework are likely to learn some new things by watching this video!

If you haven’t purchased the video series yet, please go to http://store.lhotka.net – and don’t wait, because the **special 33% discount** pricing only runs through the end of 2009!!
