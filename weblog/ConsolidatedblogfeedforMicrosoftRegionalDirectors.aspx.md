I am one of the Microsoft Regional Directors, which means that I'm in a group containing some of the most thoughtful (and sometimes challenging :) ) people in the Microsoft community. That's a humbling place to be, especially when we all get together and talk about the current and future state of technology!

The RD program has a web site, http://www.TheRegion.com, which includes an aggregated blog summary of all the RD bloggers. Not all RD's blog, but quite a few of us do, and the topics run the entire range from gadgets to hardware to networking to software development to architecture. In short, http://www.TheRegion.com is a treasure trove of great information!
