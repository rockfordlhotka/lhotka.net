I really enjoy working at Magenic – and that’s true even after 10 years.

We employ some really smart people, every one with passion for technology. Mostly .NET development of course, but also SharePoint, SQL Server, BizTalk Server and related technologies. And our Magenic Studios group has design skills (graphic, html/css and XAML), and a focus on usability, navigation and related skills.

We are hiring, especially in San Francisco and Boston, but also in Minneapolis, Chicago and Atlanta.

Are you a .NET developer? A XAML designer? An html/css designer? How about SharePoint development?

Consider [applying for a consultant position at Magenic](http://magenic.submit4jobs.com/) – it is a fun place to work with great people, often using cool technologies.
