It is a good time to be a developer/software geek in the Twin Cities!

- [Developer's Guild](http://www.twincitiesdevelopersguild.com/) - the art and science of building software
- [XNA user group](http://www.twincitiesxnausergroup.com/) - building games on the Microsoft platform
- [Languages user group](http://www.twincitieslanguagesusergroup.com/TCLUG/Default.aspx) - for that inner language/compiler lover within each of us


I'll be speaking at the Developer's Guild on August 12, giving a preview of CSLA Light (CSLA .NET for Silverlight) - probably its first public showing.
