![](http://www.lhotka.net/images/csla-lt_logo_42.jpg)[Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) is sponsoring a [webcast about CSLA .NET for Silverlight](http://guest.cvent.com/EVENTS/Info/Invitation.aspx?e=da98361f-26c1-4ba4-bf39-6fb40912fc00) on November 13. The presenter is my colleague, Sergey Barskiy. Sergey is one of the lead developers on the CSLA .NET 3.6 project, and this should be a very educational webcast.
