[Pat Helland reminds](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2004/10/28/249133.aspx) me (us?) that technology is fun, but there are much bigger and more important things in life.

Not only did his blog entry bring tears to my eyes, but it reminded me that discussions of VB vs C# or Java vs .NET are intellectually enjoyable, but pale in comparison next to things like Bush vs Kerry or my mother's recovery from last week's hip surgery or the excitement of my son at Best Buy last night when he bought the expansion for Star Wars Galaxies. *Those* things have real and tangible meaning and value.

Whether we program with or without semi-colons or with a J or an N really don't matter at all in comparison...
