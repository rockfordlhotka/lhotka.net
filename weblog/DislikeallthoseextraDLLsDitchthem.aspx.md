Brant Estes, a fellow [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) consultant, wrote a very interesting [blog entry](http://blog.magenic.com/brante/archive/2006/01/03/2183.aspx) showing how you can embed those pesky extra DLLs into your EXE, and yet have .NET find them when needed. He even tried it with CSLA .NET, creating a single EXE that embeds the CSLA assembly as a resource - very cool!
