Version 2.1.2 of CSLA .NET is now available for download from [this location](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

Version 2.1.2 includes some bug fixes and minor enhancements. The enhancements are primarily around the CslaDataSource web control, which now provides more integrated support for paging and sorting.

Most importantly, version 2.1.2 is the specific version described in my *CSLA .NET Version 2.1 Handbook*. I am releasing this as a ~160 page ebook, available in editions for both C# and VB, for purchase directly from my web site.

Look for the C# edition in the very near future (it is in the final review stage).

This new book is best thought of as a sequel to my Expert C# 2005 Business Objects and Expert VB 2005 Business Objects books. It covers the changes made since CSLA .NET 2.0 was released: how the framework has changed, and how to use the new features and capabilities. Please note that this *is not a replacement* for those books: it expands on them.

Releasing this as an ebook in PDF format is a risk on my part. I put just as much time and effort into writing this book as I have any other book I've written, but I want to provide a more cost-effective way for you to purchase this material than through normal publishing channels. It is my sincere hope that you will purchase this book if you read it (even after a few people have purchased it and they start sharing it for free).

I'm not giving up on traditional publishing channels necessarily. I'll most likely use a traditional publishing approach when I reach a point that CSLA .NET and/or my thinking changes to such a degree that there'd be value for you, as a reader, in me rewriting my books in a major way. But when I'm writing about extra functionality that rests on the existing work, it seems like I'm providing better value to you by selling a lower-cost sequel than forcing you to repurchase much of the same material to get at the new parts.

But all this hinges on people's honesty. On your honesty.

I hope you enjoy CSLA .NET 2.1.2, and the new book. Thank you, code well, have fun!
