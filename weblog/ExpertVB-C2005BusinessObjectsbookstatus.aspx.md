Here's another status update on the books.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p>

I am done with the C# book, and it is still on schedule to be available at the end of March.<o:p></o:p>

I am in the final revision stages with the VB book, so it is still on schedule to be available mid-April.<o:p></o:p>

Since posting the [beta code](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download20.aspx), people have pointed out a couple bugs (which I've fixed), one bug which can't be fixed without breaking the book (so it will be fixed later - and it isn't a show-stopper anyway) and a few feature requests (which will obviously come later).<o:p></o:p>

I expect to be able to put the final version 2.0 code for both books online around March 13.<o:p></o:p>

I'm also working with [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com/) to have them host a new online forum. The plan is to use Community Server 2.0, hosted on a server at Magenic and most likely available through forums.lhotka.net (though that's not for sure at this point).<o:p></o:p>

So the next few weeks look to be exciting (anticipated):<o:p></o:p>
