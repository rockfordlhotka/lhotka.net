According to [this article](http://news.com.com/New+file+system+has+long+road+to+Windows/2100-1016_3-5487641.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5487641&amp;subj=news.1016.20), quoting Microsoft VP Muglia, WinFS probably won't show up for real until sometime in the next decade - the version of Windows Server *after* Longhorn Server.

And people were wondering why I wasn't so excited about WinFS and the related ObjectSpaces technology...

Now it looks like the primary feature of Longhorn Server will be componentization. Which is nothing to sneeze at and is probably far more important on a day-to-day basis than WinFS anyway.
