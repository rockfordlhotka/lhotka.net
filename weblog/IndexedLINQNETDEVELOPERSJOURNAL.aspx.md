Aaron Erickson, a fellow [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) consultant, has done a lot of research and work on how to index LINQ queries over objects. He just published an article on the topic: [Indexed LINQ](http://dotnet.sys-con.com/read/406638.htm).

While indexing these queries has a cost, due to building the index, it can be very beneficial if you are doing a lot of queries over a large set of data.
