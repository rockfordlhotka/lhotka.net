The final release of CSLA 4 version 4.5.20 is now available for download

http://www.cslanet.com/Download.html

It is also available via NuGet.

CSLA .NET is a software development framework that helps you build a powerful, maintainable business logic layer for WinRT (Windows 8), WPF, Web, service-oriented, Windows Phone, Silverlight, and workflow applications.

This new release adds support for Windows Phone 8 to the existing support for .NET 4, .NET 4.5, Windows Runtime (WinRT), and Silverlight 5.

It also includes some important bug fixes, and relatively minor enhancements in other areas of the framework. So if you are using any previous version of 4.5 you really should upgrade to this new release to realize these benefits.

One other note: this release uses a new WIX-based installer, and so it shouldn’t have the issues people encountered with the InstallShield-based installer used in the previous release. As always, I generally recommend using NuGet to include the assemblies in your projects, as that’s the simplest and most reliable approach.
