I am spending a few days working with a client for [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com), having a great time discussing how to apply and extend CSLA .NET to meet their needs.

The client is from Montreal and so they speak French. Today I learned that CSLA, spoken quickly, sounds like c'est cela in French, which means "That's it".

Hopefully that equates to being cool, or being the "it" solution :)
