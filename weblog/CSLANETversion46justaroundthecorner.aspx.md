![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarimerLLC/csla/master/Support/Logos/csla%20win8_full.png)I am very excited about the upcoming CSLA .NET 4.6 release – just a few days away now.

Thanks to [Jason Bock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonrbock) we'll now have analyzers in Visual Studio 2015 to help you identify and fix some of the most common coding errors when building business classes.

And of course we've added support for .NET 4.6, Universal Windows Platform, and the latest Xamarin iOS/Android versions.

Here’s a list of the [existing/planned changes](https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.6.100+).
