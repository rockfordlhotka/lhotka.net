It is time to register for VS Live or Modern Apps Live (register for either and get access to both!) in Las Vegas, March 7-11, 2016.


> (I had to really concentrate to type 2016 – a whole new year already!!)


This is going to be a great set of conferences, co-located at Bally’s right as exciting new things like .NET Core and ASP.NET 5 are coming available.

Visual Studio Live! includes content across the spectrum of mobile, Windows, web, and services development, with a healthy dose of ALM, TFS, and other cool tools.

Modern Apps Live! provides a unique conference experience, walking through every aspect of modern app development for iOS, Android, single-page web apps, and Windows, with an Azure-based backend, discussions about managing distributed teams, continuous integration, building code for testability, and wrapping up with great content around data analytics. If you want the end-to-end story on how to successfully build a modern cross-platform app this is the conference for you.

I look forward to seeing you in Las Vegas!
