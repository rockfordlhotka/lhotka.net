<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Every now and then I post a list of what I’ve been reading lately. You’ll note that I don’t read all that many computer books. I live computers day in and day out, and when I sit down to read, the last thing I typically want to do is read more stuff about computers (unless it is gaming-related)…</font>

<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Vernor Vinge - </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Fire Upon the Deep</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812515285)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">, </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Deepness in the Sky</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812536355)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> and the upcoming </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Rainbows End</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312856849)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> </font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I am confident that Rainbows End will absolutely rock! Vinge has yet to disappoint. Seriously. I’ve read almost everything the man has written and it has always been excellent. This includes </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">True Names</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312862075)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">, his novella that is wrapped together with a set of mid-1990’s essays on the Internet (which are interesting in and of themselves, especially given the perspective of reading them 10 years later). And of course </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Peace War</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0765308835)<font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman"> is an absolute must-read (I read it as a multi-part serial in Analog magazine so many, many years ago).<o:p></o:p></font></font></font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Alastair Reynolds - </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Revelation Space</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441009425)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">, </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Chasm City</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441010644)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">, </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Redemption Ark</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044101173X)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> and </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Absolution Gap</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441012914)<o:p></o:p>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I’ve mentioned Reynolds before, but he’s worth mentioning again, as these are four of the best books I’ve read in a long time. An excellent blend of sci-fi, science, nanotech and a nice, edgy, cyberpunk-ish flavor.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">John Scalzi - </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Old Man's War</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765315246)<o:p></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Billy Hollis put me on to this author, and he’s quite good. Not as deep or intense as the other authors listed here, but if you are looking for a fun, thoughtful and quick read this is the book for you. I really enjoyed the book, and </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Ghost Brigades</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765315025)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> is on my reading list.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Timothy Zahn - </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Angelmass</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081258418X)<o:p></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I’m a serious Timothy Zahn fan. He wrote the best series of Star Wars books out there, hands down (it starts with </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Heir to the Empire</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553296124)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">). </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cobra</font>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743488474/qid=1145207602)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> was an incredible book and social commentary that has been translated into other forms, such as a ST:TNG episode. I see that it is a full-blown trilogy now (I’ve read I and II, but I was much better than II…) I should say too that his Conueror’s series left me cold, so he’s not as consistent as Vinge… Angelmass was a really fun read though, and I recommend it.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Joe Haldeman - </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Camoflauge</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441011616)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> </font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">This book is a brain-bender. He had me guessing who was who until near the end of the book. Really enjoyable and thought provoking, and it is a quick read. Haldeman is an excellent author, so make sure to check out </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Forever War</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060510862)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> as well.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Karen Armstrong - </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A History of God</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345384563)

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">OK, so this is a college textbook – or at least it is often used as such. But if you are looking for a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">very</i> thought provoking summary of the evolution of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all rolled into a single book this is hard to beat. It is particularly interesting because Armstrong puts the various events and evolutions of what “god” means and who “god” is into a historical context. She also draws on and compares various conflicting views of theologians, contrasting the interpretations of events and religious texts.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Superheroes and Philosophy</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812695739)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">, </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Star Wars and Philosophy</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812695836)

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">I find philosophy intriguing. In many ways it requires the same type of thought process as software design and computer programming, but it is even more abstract. These two books are part of a broader series (including two books using The Matrix movie), where philosophers write articles about philosophy, using contemporary concepts like superheroes (Superman, Spiderman, stuff like that) or Star Wars to draw out and illustrate their points. I find the approach very accessible and downright fun, because the books draw together two of my interests at the same time.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Sells, <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Griffiths</st1:city></st1:place> - </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Programming WPF</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596101139)

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Yes, I do read <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">some</i> programming books :)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the moment I’m trying to have at least a basic familiarity with WPF and XAML. I am firmly of the opinion that if normal developers ever need to actually see or use XAML that this whole experiment is an utter failure, but for the next few years it is clear that we’re stuck in tag-land… Maybe by version 2.0 of WinFx the tools will have evolved to the point where the technology will actually be useful and productive, and humans won’t be subservient to obscure angle-brackets. In the meantime however, if you are looking to understand how WPF works, you can’t beat this book.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Eric Evans – </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Doman-Driven Design</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321125215)

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">This book has been sitting on my reading list for quite a while now, and I’ve finally gotten the time to skim through it. It is very good, and I appreciate many of the author’s points. Like almost all books of this sort (including David West’s </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Object Thinking</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619654)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">), I really like what the book has to say, but don’t necessarily agree with all the conclusions or solutions. All choices are trade-offs, based on a set of priorities. Evans’ choices are all perfectly valid, but don’t always reflect my set of priorities and thus don’t always agree with my choices. I think this is the beauty of working in the computer field – there are such a wide variety of options that you can apply to problems that you can almost always arrive at valid solutions based on your priorities – even while other (equally valid) solutions exist in the same problem space.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Neal Stephenson – </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The System of the World</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060750863)

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Stephenson rocks. I do believe he is the most talented author writing today, in terms of his mastery of language and ability to paint the most exquisite mental images with his writing. He’s also perhaps the most dense author going; in that there’s no wasted space in his books. Unlike most books (even most of them listed here) where you can often skip a sentence or even a paragraph now and then without losing the story, with Stephenson you can’t ever skip anything. You can’t gloss over anything. You have to take the time to read, comprehend and remember what’s been said, because everything becomes important later. I love it!! This book is the last of a trilogy, and the trilogy is a “prequel” to </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cryptonomicon</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060512806)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3"> (which you should really read first though). I’ve been working on the trilogy for a very long time now (months), savoring every bit of it. </font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Whether you like these dense pseudo-historical books or not, I <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">strongly</i> recommend reading Stephenson’s </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Snowcrash</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553562614)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">. This book, along with Gibson’s </font>[<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Neuromancer</font>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441007465)<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">, really defines the cyberpunk genre – at least for me.</font>

<o:p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp;</font></o:p>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Anyway, that’s what I’ve been reading lately. Of course my reading list is long, and seems to grow longer faster than I can read. Hopefully in a few months I’ll have ploughed through a few more books to list in another entry.</font>
