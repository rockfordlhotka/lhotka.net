I am very happy to report that I'll be giving a full-day workshop on distributed object-oriented application design in .NET this fall at [VS Live Orlando](http://www.vslive.com). If you are interested in this topic in general, or CSLA .NET specifically, then here's an opportunity to get a full day brain-dump as part of a great overall conference!

Over the past year I've given some 2 hour sessions on this topic as part of the main VS Live conference, and I've had several people come up after the session asking why it isn't a full-day workshop. After all, it is a very big topic to cover in justÂ a couple hours!

Fawcette agrees, and so has decided to do a pre-con for the Orlando conference in September on the topic.

While I'll certainly cover some basic concepts and ideas around distributed object-oriented systems, the fact is that I'll be focusing mostly on how these concepts shaped CSLA .NET and how CSLA .NET addresses many of the issues we face when designing and building such systems. I'll discuss serialization, remoting, n-level undo, why reflection is sometimes very useful, abstraction of business logic and encapsulation of business data and more. I'll also discuss the creation of Windows, Web and Web services interfaces to the business objects.

I'll also dive into some of the more advanced issues that have come up on the CSLA .NET email forum - including items such as concurrency, near real-time notification of simultaneous edits, centralization of business logic (the RuleManager functionality), object-relational mapping issues (including dealing with inheritance) and some thoughts on batch processing and reporting.

Finally, I also plan to spend a bit of time discussing what .NET 2.0 means to object-oriented programming. I'll discuss the (very cool) new data binding enhancements in Windows Forms, and the (not quite as cool) enhancements in Web Forms. I'll also talk about what Indigo is likely to mean for distributed object-oriented systems - including a discussion about why using remoting today is not at all a bad thing!
