I few weeks ago I posted about my new Nokia Lumia 1520 “phablet”: [Lumia 1520- First thoughts](http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/Lumia1520FirstThoughts.aspx "Lumia 1520- First thoughts")

Tomorrow my new Lumia 1020 will replace the 1520.

Why?

Because the 1520 is just too big. Otherwise I really like it in a lot of ways – high def screen, easy to read content, very fast, slot for MicroSD card.

But it doesn’t fit nicely into my pockets, and it is very awkward to hold up to my ear when talking (yes, I often use BlueTooth, but not always).

Mostly though, even with my big hands (I’m 2m tall after all) I can’t use it one-handed. &lt;insert texting while driving jokes here&gt; In reality this has nothing to do with driving as I have a good hands-free setup in my truck. This has to do with normal everyday use of the phone, and the reality that it *never* works one-handed, even for basic things like pulling it out of my pocket to answer a call.

I have high hopes for the 1020. It is the size of my 920, which I loved, and has a much better camera. I don’t believe it has a MicroSD slot though, which is the only real negative I can see.
