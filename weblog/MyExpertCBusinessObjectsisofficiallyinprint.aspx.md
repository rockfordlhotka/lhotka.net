![](/images/3448.gif)I just got my author copies of the book, so it has been printed and is in distribution! This should mean that, any day now,Â bookstores will get copies and Amazon should start shipping them.

[Click here](/ArticleIndex.aspx?area=CSLA%20.NET) for more information on both the VB .NET and C# editions of the book, as well as links to the code, the online discussion forum and other related information.
