My email provider just emailed me to let me know that emails to my lhotka.net addresses (and in particular my admin @ lhotka.net address) may have been lost between October 10-14.

I am posting this on my blog, because that admin address is the location people email to get support from http://store.lhotka.net.

So if you emailed me for support or help with purchasing my ebooks within the past few days, and I haven't responded, it is probably because the emails were lost. Please email me again and I'll do what I can to help resolve any issues.

Thank you!
