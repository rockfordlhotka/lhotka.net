The Windows Azure team is putting together an event on June 7 where they’ll be providing some great info about Azure.

The event is live in San Francisco, but for most of us it is streaming live over the Internet.

Over the past year or so Microsoft has rolled out new features and pricing models for Azure that make the platform more and more compelling. I think they are nearing the point where the question will change from “why should I use Azure?” to “why **shouldn’t** I use Azure?”.
