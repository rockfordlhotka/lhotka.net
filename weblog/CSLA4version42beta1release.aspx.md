The Beta 1 release of CSLA 4 version 4.2 is now available for download on the [CSLA download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).

This version adds support for:

- Windows Phone 7.5 “Mango”
- mono
- mono for iOS (iPhone/iPad)
- mono for Android


Of course it continues to support .NET 4 and Silverlight 4.

This release also includes numerous bug fixes and small enhancements. In particular, Jonny has done a lot of work to make the business rules subsystem more flexible and powerful. See the [change log](http://www.lhotka.net/Article.aspx?id=2607a4ef-e6a9-4801-aa0b-518c51267339) for a list of all changes.

At this point we have spent zero time or effort on the samples. Most samples will continue to run when bound against the 4.2 assemblies, but some may encounter minor issues. The samples in the download are still bound to the 4.1 assemblies. We will be updating the samples during the 4.2 beta phase.

Because of the organizational changes of mono from Novell to Xamarin, the 4.2 release has taken a lot longer than any of us would have preferred. I am pleased that we’re entering the beta phase, and can now move deliberately toward a release.

If you are using 4.1, I *strongly recommend* that you test your code against 4.2. In part to help us identify any outstanding issues, and in part because the bug fixes and enhancements to the rules subsystem may be very helpful to you.
