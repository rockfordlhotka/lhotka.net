Some exciting news! [Dunn Training](http://www.dunntraining.com) is building a formal training class around CLSA .NET, with plans for the class to be ready in September. I often get requests for CSLA .NET training, and now there'll be a great answer.

Of course [Magenic](http://www.magenic.com) remains the premier source for consulting and mentoring around CSLA .NET. Training is important, but you can't underestimate the value of longer term mentoring!

Given the combination of my books, a formal CSLA .NET class and longer term mentoring and consulting from Magenic, a full array of CSLA .NET resources is coming into being.

And while I'm plugging Dunn Training, I should mention that they have an excellent [BizTalk Server 2006 class](http://www.dunntraining.com/BTS2006.htm) - just tell them that Rocky sent you :)

Update: Here is a [link to the information page](http://www.dunntraining.com/CSLATraining.htm) on the CSLA .NET class.
