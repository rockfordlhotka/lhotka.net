![](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/visual_basic.jpg)Thanks to a tremendous amount of time and effort on the part of Sean Rhone there’s a new release of CSLA .NET VB available for download from the [VB download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/vb.aspx).

Thank you Sean!!

This VB version of the framework should now have full parity with CSLA .NET for Windows 3.6.3. There’s one slight difference with the async data portal to work around the lack of multi-line lambda expressions in VB 9 – hopefully we’ll be able to bring that code back into parity with C# when VB 10 is available.

I recommend using this VB version of the framework as an implementation reference, not for production. The official release of CSLA .NET for Windows is the C# implementation, which is currently at version 3.7.1. It is available from the [download page](http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/download.aspx).
