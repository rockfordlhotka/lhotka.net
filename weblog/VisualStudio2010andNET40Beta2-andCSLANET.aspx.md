Microsoft has made [Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0 Beta 2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx) available for download to MSDN subscribers, with general availability soon. VS10 includes a lot of really nice features over VS2008, and I’m personally very excited to see the Beta 2 release.

I’ve made a pre-alpha CSLA .NET “4.0” available for download as well. This is really just the version 3.8.0 code (somewhere between beta 1 and beta 2) that I’ve updated to build under Visual Studio 2010 with .NET 4.0.

- [Download for Silverlight](http://www.lhotka.net/cslalight/download.aspx)


Over the next few months I’ll continue to release updates to version 4.0 that take advantage of the .NET 4.0 features, but I wanted to make sure there was a version online that builds with VS10 as soon as possible, so this is it – enjoy!
