I'll do some more real blogging at some point too - probably once I get the new Expert VB/C# Business Objects books off to the printer in just a few more weeks.

In the meantime, Billy's [history of programming languages](http://ftponline.com/weblogger/forum.aspx?ID=18&amp;DATE=01/13/2006#505) left me in stitches!
