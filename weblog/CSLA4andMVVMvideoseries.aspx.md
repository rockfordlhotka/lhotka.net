I am working on a video series discussing the use of the MVVM design pattern, plus a “zero code-behind” philosophy with CSLA .NET version 4.

I’ve decided to put the intro video out there for free. It is a good video, covering the basics of the pattern, my approach to the pattern and how a CSLA-based Model works best in the pattern.

The rest of the series will be demo-based, covering the specifics of implementation. I’ll add another blog post when that’s available for purchase, but I thought I’d get this intro online now so people can make use of it.
